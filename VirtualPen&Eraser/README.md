# Virtual Canvas


I recently came across posts on linkedin, where people were drawing virtually on the screen, originally posted by Mr. Taha Anwar. So, I thought why not try it on my own! Though the original version works on color thresholding to get extract the pen from the scene, I had a hard time(& changing light intensities in my background) finding a right range. Hence, I added an aruco marker(tag id: 0) to act as a pen. Feel free to use this version and build your version upon it. A couple of other id markers can work for various colors and even eraser.
